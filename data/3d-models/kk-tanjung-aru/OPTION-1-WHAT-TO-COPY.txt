OPTION 1: COPY THE WHOLE "top" FOLDER — NO LINES FROM tileset.json
================================================================================

You do NOT take any part of the tileset.json code and put it somewhere.

  • tileset.json is already in place:  data/3d-models/kk-tanjung-aru/tileset.json
  • That file is the index. It stays as it is.

For Option 1 you only copy FILES AND FOLDERS from your 3D Tiles export:

  WHERE TO GET THE "top" FOLDER
  ----------------------------
  From the same place that produced this tileset (e.g. GridMaster export, or
  the server/folder that 3dhub.temadigital.my uses for this model). That
  export has:
    - tileset.json  (you already have this)
    - a folder named  top
  Inside "top" there are folders: Level_11, Level_12, Level_13, Level_14,
  Level_15, Level_16, each containing .b3dm and/or .json files.

  WHAT TO COPY
  ------------
  Copy the entire folder named  top  (with Level_11, Level_12, ... Level_16
  and all the files inside them). Paste it into:

    data/3d-models/kk-tanjung-aru/

  RESULT
  ------
  Your folder should look like:

    data/3d-models/kk-tanjung-aru/
    ├── tileset.json          ← already there (do not replace with "lines of code")
    ├── top/                  ← YOU ADD THIS FOLDER (from your export)
    │   ├── Level_11/
    │   │   └── Tile_p0000_p0000.b3dm
    │   ├── Level_12/
    │   ├── Level_13/
    │   ├── Level_14/
    │   ├── Level_15/
    │   └── Level_16/
    └── (other .txt guides)

  The JSON you have only describes which files are needed; the actual 3D
  data is in the .b3dm and .json files inside the "top" folder. Get that
  "top" folder from your export and put it next to tileset.json.
